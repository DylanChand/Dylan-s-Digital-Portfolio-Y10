<p>My name is Dylan Chand, and I am 14 years old. In 2010, I was born in the Auckland Hospital in New Zealand. Mint green and purple are my favourite colours. I enjoy eating a wide range of snacks and meals. Cooking is one of my  hobbies, and I enjoy trying out to make new dishes.
</p>
<p>
Digital technology and math are two subjects that I like . I also like to code and make digital projects. I enjoy being active and doing sports with friends, so PE is another one of my favorite subjects.
</p>
<p>
In my free time, I like to read books, especially science fiction and action novels. I also enjoy playing video games, they can keep me playing for hours.
</p>
<p>   
Traveling is a passion of mine. I enjoy traveling, learning about new cultures, and sampling local cuisine. Books and video games just can't compare to the sense of excitement and discovery that travel gives me; Bali is the most enjoyable location that I've visited so far and I hope to visit more places in the not to distant future.

        I have a keen interest in digital tech and coding because they allow me to create and innovate. The challenge of writing code to solve problems is something I find something I can challenge myself with. Thinking and problem-solving skills required in coding keep me engaged, and there's always something new to learn. Plus, seeing the final product of work gives a sense of acomplishment.</p>
    <p>
      <p>
        I have strong aspirations in the field of coding,  with technology and the endless possibilities it offers. My goal is to become a proficient and innovative programmer, capable of creating impactful software and applications using different coding coding languages and techniques to produce high quality projects.
    </p>
<p>
       I also keep in mind of potentially, one day working for a leading tech company or even starting my own tech venture. To achieve this, I will continuously learn and improve my skill and try spending free time exploring new programming languages, working on personal projects, and participating in coding comps etc.

<p>I also have a passion for playing soccer and swimming.</p>
    <p>
In soccer, Cristiano Ronaldo is one of my favourite players. His dedication, skill, and determination on the field are qualities I greatly admire. Ronaldo's ability to perform under pressure, Watching his matches and studying his techniques helps me understand the level of commitment required to excel in the sport. In school I'm in the 14a team and I hope to get to first eleven next year.
</p>
<p>
Swimming is another sport I love, and Michael Phelps is my inspiration. Phelps' record-breaking achievements and his incredible focus and resilience are truly inspiring. His journey from a young swimmer to an Olympic legend shows what can be achieved with hard work and dedication. When I swim, I often think about Phelps' techniques and training routines, trying to use some of strategies into my practice.
