I play as a central defensive midfeild (CDM) in soccer, a position that requires a combination of  awareness, physical stamina, and strong defensive skills. As  CDM, I focus on breaking up the opposition's attacks, protecting our defensive line, and controlling our team's offensive plays.

Last year, my commitment to training and improving my skills played a significant part in helping my club win the championship. 
   </p>
    
    <p>
Since then I have been working on positioning, tackling, and passing etc to improve myself as a player so that I can one day make my own venture into the football world.

<p>
 Swimming is an incredibly demanding sport, requiring not only physical strength but also mental endurance and technical precision. At Hilton Brown Swimming, I focus on refining my strokes, improving my speed, and enhancing my overall technique.I spend time in the pool working on my freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly, aiming to perfect each one.
        </p>
<p>
My hard work is paying off as I am constantly improving and winning trials within my club. Each trial is an opportunity to test my skills and measure my progress and time. Competing  motivates me to push myself even harder and strive for excellence.

    My school journey has been a mix of challenges and achievements. Initially, my grades were inconsistent,  However, through hard work both in school and at home, I have started to achieve excellence consistently.
        </p>
<p>
 I began by setting clear goals for each subject and creating a study schedule that allowed me to focus on my weak areas while inforcing my strengths. Regular revision,  participation,  seeking help from teachers  became part of I did more often.

At home, I dedicated time to reviewing my notes, completing assignments diligently, and practicing problem-solving. 
My efforts started to pay off as I saw a noticeable improvement in my grades. The consistency in my performance boosted my confidence and motivated me to keep pushing myself. Achieving excellence consistently has taught me perseverance, time management, and the value of a positive mindset.
